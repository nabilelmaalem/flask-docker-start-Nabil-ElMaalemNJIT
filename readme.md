# Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, and Docker

In this assignment, you need to setup the project and add the remote interpreter for the project using the Dockerfile or
docker-compose flask service. You are required to add a new field to the database model called address and populate it
with an address
using the faker library. The address field should appear when a user is selected from the /users route. You will need to
set the seed to 4321 in the [conftest.py](tests/conftest.py) file order to generate the same data set that I use for my
tests. Your first record should be "Jason Brown" and the address should be, "9335 Gloria Street Suite 675 Mathisport, PR
63759".

My teacher test is looking for this address.

Your users/1 page should look like this [Screenshot](readme_images/address_field_added.png).

You need to run the [tests/test_add_user.py](tests/test_add_user.py) file with pytest, so that it
creates the users.

You will need to make the following changes to make this work:

1. Modify the [application/database/__ini__.py](application/database/__init__.py) to add an address field.
2. Run the command to create a migration: flask db migrate -m "added address field"
3. Run the command to apply the migration: flask db upgrade
4. Modify the [tests/conftest.py Fixture](tests/conftest.py) to populate the address field
   with [faker address](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/providers/faker.providers.address.html).
5. Set the seed in [tests/conftest.py Fixture](tests/conftest.py) to 4321
6. Modify the [application/bp/homepage/templates/user.html](application/bp/homepage/templates/user.html) file to add the
   jinja code to display the address field.

## Fix Mac Permission Error after docker compose up --build  command - Run these on the terminal

* chmod +x ./development.sh
* chmod +x ./production.sh

# Readings - You should at least look these over because you will need to refer to these in the future for your project.

# Docker Commands

* docker compose up --build <- builds the image in development mode and shares the volume
* docker compose up <- runs the previously built image without redoing the build process
* docker build -t myapp . <- builds it to run with gunicorn in production mode
* docker run -itp 80:8080 myapp <- runs the website / flask in console output mode
* docker exec -it <containerid> bash <- logs into container (replace <containerid> with the container id)
* docker run -itp 80:8080 myapp pytest <-runs pytest in the container image

# Flask Migrate / Alembic Commands - Must delete the migrations and instance folder / database. These will reset it

* flask db init <-initializes migrations (don't need to do this the project has its first migration)
* flask db migrate -m "Initial migration." <-change the message to whatever describes the schema change
* flask db upgrade <- applies the migrations
